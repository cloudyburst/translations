# Ritim Translations
Ritim is available in various different languages.
If you want Ritim to be shown in a language you can speak, <br>you can create a PR with the file containing the translations. Help is always appreciated.

## File structure
Create a file named `[YourLanguageCode].json`, and copy the contents of<br>`en-US.json` in it. Change the "TRANSLATION" part according to your language.
```json
{
  "TRANSLATION": {
    "CODE": "en-US",
    "NAME": "English",
    "AUTHOR": "Ritim Developers"
  },
  "STRINGS": {
    ...
  }
}
